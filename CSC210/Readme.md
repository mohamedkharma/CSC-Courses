# CSC-21000
CSc 21000 - Assembly Language Programming

# DESCRIPTION
Computer structure, machine representation of data, addressing and indexing, computation and control instructions, assembly language and assemblers; procedures(subroutines) and data segments, linkages and subroutine calling conventions, loaders; practical use of an assembly language for computer implementation of illustrative examples.

# Notes
- This course required using an Assembly emulator x86.
- Use emu8086 to run the exectable code
- Project 1 is an emulator for x86, capable of running simple assembler code (binary format).
- Porject 2 is a 2021 Calender built using assembly language.
