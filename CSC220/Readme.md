# CSC-22000
CSc 22000 - Algorithms

# DESCRIPTION
In this course, we covered, measuring algorithmic complexity (ONotation); searching and sorting algorithms and their complexity; tree and graph algorithms and their complexity; classes of algorithms, such as divide-andconquer, backtracking, greedy, probabilistic, etc. Computational complexity; the classes P and NP. 

# COURSE OUTCOMES
1. The student acquires knowledge of how to specify and determine algorithm behavior (worst-case runtime, expected runtime of randomized algorithms; Asymptotic Analysis with O and Omega; Analysis of Recursions)
2. The student acquires knowledge of how to compare the advantages and limitations of distinct algorithms that perform the same task (compare sorting algorithms: bubble-, insertion-, merge-, heap-, quick-, radixsort; compare minimum spanning tree algorithms: Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithm; compare BFS and DFS)
3. The student acquires knowledge of some classes of algorithmic paradigms, e.g., divide-and-conquer, randomized, greedy, use of data structures, etc.(mergesort for divide-and-conquer, quicksort for randomized, heapsort and Prim's algorithm for use of data structures, Kruskal's algorithm for greedy)
