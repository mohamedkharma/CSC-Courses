CSc 10400 - Discrete Mathematical Structures

# DESCRIPTION
Introduction to the mathematics fundamental to all phases of computers science, from the formulation of problems to the understanding of their underlying structure, to the comparative analysis of the complexity of algorithms that can be used to solve these problems. The course introduces combinatorics, first-order logic, induction, set theory, relations and functions, graphs, and trees.

# COURSE OUTCOMES
Knowledge of basic discrete mathematical structures and techniques needed in Computer Science, including those in: 
1. Combinatorics 
2. Logic and proofs 
3. Set theory 
4. Relations and functions 
5. Graphs and trees
